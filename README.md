# The Dropping Dementor
Software needed for the operation of the Dropping Dementor Animatronic!

This was my first attempt to make a Halloween prop based off of ESP8266 microcontrollers, a project I absolutely loved from start to finish!

There are two parts; The dropping mechanism and the person detector.

The detector uses an ultrasonic distance sensor to see when anyone is walking nearby.

The dropping mechanism moves a locking pin to allow a reel to freely spin and drop the ghost! It then motorizes the reel and re-engages the locking pin to reset the ghost for the next scare.

Here's a link to a video detailing its creation and use :)
