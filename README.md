# DroppingDementor
Software needed for the operation of the Dropping Dementor Animatronic

There are two parts, the dropping mechanism and the person detector.
<br>
The detector uses a ultrasonic distance sensor to see if anyone is walking nearby.
<br>
The dropping mechanism moves a pin to allow a reel to spin to drop the ghost and then resets the ghost for the next scare.

Here's a link to a video detailing its creation and use :)
